# PythonThreadedServer
HTTP server implementation with python. This server allows multiple connections at same time.

I have used netifaces external library
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces#downloads

You can simply run this and create a http server in your machine.
This works well for displaying web pages, sharing files inside the network.
